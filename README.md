# Ataxia Game Engine #

## About This Version ##

Ataxia is a modern MUD engine originally written in Go, but was rewritten in Rust.  This fork is based on the last Go
commit, currently in the `golang` branch of the parent repo.  What follows is the original documentation, for now:

## About ##

Ataxia is a modern MUD engine written Go. It heavily utilizes concurrency and uses Lua for commands
and game logic.

## Install ##

First, install Go. Ataxia is written to work with the current Go1 release. See: http://golang.org/doc/install

Second, you should install gpm and gvp:

Once everything is installed:
